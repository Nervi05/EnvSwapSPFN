# This is <ins>NOT</ins> a port of HBL to Aroma and <ins>NOT</ins> an application to use ELF applications on Aroma.

## Wii U Environment Swapper

This is a really simple app that just restarts your console and swaps your environment. Makes life a lot easier when you need ELF homebrew though.

### Building

To build this make sure you have `devkitPro`, `devkitPPC` and `wut` installed via the (dkp-)pacman package manager. Then just run `make` in the same directory as the Makefile and use the resulting wuhb/rpx.
